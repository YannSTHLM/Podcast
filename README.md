Development
- This is a static HTML/JS app; edit files and serve with a local static server for development.
## Install as a Web App (PWA)
This site supports being installed as a web app on most modern browsers.

- Desktop / Android (Chrome, Edge, etc.): use the browser's install prompt or click the **Install App** button in the site header or in the **Manage Subscriptions** modal. The browser will show a native install dialog.
